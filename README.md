# UFOs
## Overview of Project
In this project, we were tasked with using HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive webpage that allows users to filter (fictional) UFO sightings stored in a database. The user can filter based on date, city, state, country and shape of what was observed. <br/>

## Results
The user can search the database using five different search criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape of what was observed.  This can be done by using by scrolling down and using the text entry containers on the left-hand side of the page. It should be noted that the entries are case-sensitive and all entries should be lowercase.<br/>
Once the page is first loaded, all of the listings in the databse can be seen, as shown below.


Shown below are the results of using the filter to show only the instances in the database where the shape seen was listed as "other".
